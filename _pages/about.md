My name is Yiding Sun (孙一丁, in Chinese). I am currently a 3rd-year master student (will graduate in 2025.6 in expectation) at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China. My supervisor is [Prof. Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/). Previously, I earned my bachelor degree in College of Computer Science under supervise of [Prof. Ying Zhang](https://dbis.nankai.edu.cn/2023/0322/c12139a506904/page.htm) and [Prof. Gang Wang](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2021/0323/c13619a490377/page.htm), Nankai University, China.

My research interests lie in the pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Explainable Recommendations. I am searching for a full-time job of machine learning engineer, focusing on LLMs (pretraining, data, and fine-tuning) and recommendations, mainly based in Beijing.
