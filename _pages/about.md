My name is Yiding Sun (孙一丁, in Chinese). I currently work at Tencent as a machine learning engnieer. Previously, I earned my master degree in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China, in supervision of [Prof. Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/) and bachelor degree at [College of Computer Science](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/), Nankai University. Additionally, I served as PC member of SIGIR, ARR and so on.

My research interests lie in the Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agents in Advertisement.
